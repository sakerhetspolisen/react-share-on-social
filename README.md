## Features

- Uses the [Web Share API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/share) for [supported browsers](https://caniuse.com/web-share)
- Copy to clipboard functionality using [copy-to-clipboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/copy-to-clipboard)
- Uses [React Portal](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) to render the component outside the parent DOM hierarchy

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-share-on-social
```

or, if you're using yarn:

```bash
yarn add react-share-on-social
```

## Usage

Passing the `linkFavicon` prop drastically improves UX for devices that use the fallback. Without `linkFavicon`, the fallback renders a grey box instead.

> Note: The Web Share API only works in secure contexts (HTTPS). Read more [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-share/#security-and-privacy-considerations).

```js
import React from "react";
import ShareOnSocial from "react-share-on-social";
import favicon from "../assets/favicon.png";

const Example = () => {
  return (
    <ShareOnSocial
      textToShare="Check out this new wardrobe I just found from IKEA!"
      link="https://ikea.com/wardrobes/kalle"
      linkTitle="KALLE Wardorbe which chooses your clothes for you using AI - IKEA"
      linkMetaDesc="Stop going through the agony of choosing clothes that fit the weather and your mood."
      linkFavicon={favicon}
      noReferer
    >
      <button>Share this product</button>
    </ShareOnSocial>
  );
};
```
